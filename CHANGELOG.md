# Changelog

Changes that users or agents will notice. Before 1.0, a minor version may change the protocol or the output; those changes are marked.

## Unreleased

- Protocol version 1: the libraries send `"protocol": 1` in every header. The CLI stops with `protocol_too_new` when a library is newer than it, and still reads older ones.
- `ddp history` works on iOS. The library records every change, tap, swipe and screen for the last 15 minutes, like on Android.
- History throttles to 4 captures a second (was 10) while only a clock or spinner changes, and detects those animations even when they skip captures. About 4% CPU on the samples with a clock that never stops.
- History stamps a touch when the finger went down, so a swipe shows before what it caused.
- The libraries have unit tests (`ChangeTracker`, frame signatures, gzip), run in CI.
- Code layout: `checks/` has one file per check; capture code moved to `Capture.kt` and `Capture.swift`.
- docs/README.md, STATUS.md, DECISIONS.md, a decision log and ADRs 0001 to 0006.
- README rewritten with real output, prompts to give an agent, MCP setup and a FAQ.
- ARCHITECTURE.md, docs/protocol.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, SECURITY.md and AGENTS.md for contributors.
- CI also checks `rustfmt` and `clippy`, and builds the iOS and Android libraries.

## 0.1.0 (2026-10-23)

First public release.

- `ddp` CLI as one native Rust binary, on npm as `agent-ddp`. iOS library by SwiftPM, Android library by JitPack.
- Live mode: `connect`, `tree`, `find`, `get`, `read`, `watch`, `eval`, `time`, `net`, `tap`, `wait`, `logs`, `set`, `open`, `annotate`, `explore`.
- Checks: overlap, corners, jank, settle, a11y, timeline, parity, baseline, all. Each exits 1 on a problem.
- `ddp history` (Android): the last 15 minutes from a flight recorder in the library.
- For agents: guides inside the CLI (`ddp skills`), `doctor`, errors with a next step, `@eN` refs, sessions, `batch`, output limits and an MCP server.
